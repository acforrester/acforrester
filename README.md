# Hello there! üëã

### I'm an economist and statistician working in Washington, DC.

I serve as an economist and the lead demographer for the [Division of Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)](https://www.bls.gov/lau/) at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. I'm also a PhD student in statistical science at the [Joint Program in Survey Methodology and Data Science](https://jpsm.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu) and an Adjunct Scholar at the [Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/people/andrew-forrester). 

I have extensive knowledge and expertise working with federal data and applied statistical methods.

- üìä Applied statistics, econometrics, and data science
