# Hello there! 👋

### I'm an economist working in Washington, DC.

I work as an economist and statistician at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Division of Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) and an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute. I previously worked in public policy as a researcher and scholar at the Cato Institute where I worked on immigration policy, consumer and mortgage finance, and labor economics.

I have extensive knowledge and expertise working with federal data and applied statistical methods.

#### I'm interested in:
- 📊 Applied statistics, econometrics, and data science
- 📈 Economic data
- 💸 Finance and banking
- 🏙️ Demography and urban development

#### I am an expert in:

- Extracting, manipulating, and analyzing numerous public and private datasets (see below).
- Applying econometric and quasi-experimental methods.
- Time series modelling, forecasting, and seasonal adjustment
- Using data science methods to examine big data and validate statistical models.
- Manipulating, tabulating, and estimating variance for survey data from a variety of survey designs.
- Writing and publishing research in peer-reviewed journals, book chapters, and policy brief series and presenting research at professional conferences.

#### I also enjoy cleaning data! Here are some datasets that I've cleaned:
